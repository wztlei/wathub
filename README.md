# WatHub

Discover useful information about the University of Waterloo with WatHub! Having issues with UWaterloo Portal? If so, give this app a try! WatHub is made by UW students, for UW students.

Here are some features that are currently offered:
- <b>Food Service Locations</b>: Places serving food and beverages on campus, including operating hours and detailed outlet information.
- <b>Open Classrooms</b>: A schedule for when classrooms are unused and available for students to study and host events.
- <b>Points of Interest</b>: ATMs, libraries, and other interesting places and things to see across campus.
- <b>Events</b>: Information regarding events taking place around campus.
- <b>News</b>: News curated by various sources affiliated with the University of Waterloo.
- <b>Parking</b>: Real-time parking counts in select parking lots across campus.
- <b>Weather</b>: Current weather details from the University of Waterloo Weather Station.
- <b>Courses</b>: Information about courses offered, including general info, prerequisites, course schedules, enrollment info, and exam schedules.

More features are coming soon! I am currently working on adding:
- <b>Employer Info Sessions</b>: On-campus recruitment events at the University of Waterloo to connect companies and students.
- <b>Class Enrollment</b>: Live data about class enrollment numbers and notifications when space in a course is available.
- <b>Exam Schedule</b>: Customizable exam schedules with notifications as the exam time approaches.

This was built by forking the Citrus app made by Christian De Angelis which is no longer being maintained. I obtained his source code under the MIT License, so I am now continuously adding new features to WatHub!
